# I320D-FTOSS
Final Project for Fine tuning Open-Source Software in Spring 2025

This project was done by Jessica Nguyen, Pablo Carbajo Derennes, and Tanya Arya.

## Goal
The main goal of this project was to create an AI-powered book recommender that was able to adapt the user's request(s). For example, if the user requests for a book within a certain price point and a certain genre, the AI book recommender would be able to give a legitimate book that met the criteria.
